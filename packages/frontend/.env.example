# API URL for production deployment
# VITE_API_URL should NOT end with /api/v1 etc if the code appends it.
# Based on code:
# authStore appends /auth/login -> so base should be http://localhost:3001/api if local? 
# Wait, authStore had http://localhost:3001/api originally.
# useQuestGeneration had http://localhost:3001 and appends /api/generate
# We need to be careful about consistency.
# Let's check the replaced values.
# authStore: VITE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3001/api'
# useQuestGeneration: VITE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3001'
# This implies VITE_API_URL usually points to the root, but authStore expects it to include /api?
# This is inconsistent. I should unify them or note it.
# useQuestGeneration calls `${API_URL}/api/generate` -> if API_URL is localhost:3001 -> localhost:3001/api/generate.
# authStore calls `${API_URL}/auth/login`. if API_URL is localhost:3001/api -> localhost:3001/api/auth/login.
# So if I set VITE_API_URL to https://backend.com, useQuestGeneration will call https://backend.com/api/generate.
# But authStore will call https://backend.com/auth/login (missing /api) if I set it to https://backend.com.
# If I set it to https://backend.com/api, authStore works, but useQuestGeneration becomes https://backend.com/api/api/generate.
# I need to fix the code to be consistent.

# I will fix the code first in the next step. For now, this file is just a template.
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
